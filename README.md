# dependencies
- [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#automatic-installer)

- [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)

- `python -m pip install pipenv`
(This installs pip which will later be used to set up pipenv. Try not to confuse the commands via terminal history like amp did)

- [make](https://www.technewstoday.com/install-and-use-make-in-windows/)

- `winget install gnuwin32.make`

- don't forget to add make to the path in windows. example: `C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin` *on a real OS this isn't a problem, but on windows you gotta use gnumake*

- Watchman (for pyre type checking):
    - macOS: `brew install watchman`
    - ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install watchman`
